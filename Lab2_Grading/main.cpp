/*
* Things to add:
*   (DONE) fix the spacing with /t, thanks aman

*   (DONE) add size checking and start char are A01/A00 for student_number
*   add bounds for all grades need to be between 0.0 and 100.0
*   replace number_of_student with the size function
*   Move the functions and structs into a class
* 
*   add delete_student() fnc
*       delete a student in a class
*   add load_Class() fnc
*       load grades from a class
*       replace print grades?
*   add save_Class() fnc
*       store the grades of a class into text files7
* 
*   implement load/save/delete with text files
